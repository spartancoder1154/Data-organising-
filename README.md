This Python script performs data wrangling and basic analysis on a raw string of medical information. It extracts patient names, ages, BMI values, and insurance costs from an unstructured text block, cleans the data by removing excess whitespace and replacing special characters, and organizes it into usable lists. The code then calculates and displays the average BMI and average insurance cost, and prints formatted summaries for each patient. This project is a simple but practical example of transforming messy real-world data into structured, analyzable output, making it a useful starting point for beginners in data analysis.
